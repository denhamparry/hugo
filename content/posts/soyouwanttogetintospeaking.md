Over the last 2 years, I've gone from attending my first conference to speaking at them.
I've had the pleasure of travelling around the world and making lots of new friends, and now I have a new career.
This is a no-holds bared review of whats happened and tips that I wish I had throughout this journey.

My main take away from that conference was that I loved solving problems and thats why I started developing.
One problem that I was dealing with was my personal mental health.  I was depressed and up to this point I didn't think I could fix it.
After speaking to my Doctor, I had some tests and found that I had an under active thyroid.
Every day, I take a pill that boosts hormone levels and has significantly helped me day to day.
If you suffer from mental health issues, lots of people do but you need to find professional advice to get it fixed.

## Attending Meetups

Back home, the bug had hit me.  In my lunch breaks I was lining up talks from conferences past.
I was actively learning in a job that didn't push me, this was scratching an itch of solving problems.
At work, we'd run 2 week sprints that would get completed within 2 days.
This was due to office politics, and being able to securely manage a deployment pipeline by taking over 1 month to deliver code.
I started to use Vim as my primary IDE, only so th
