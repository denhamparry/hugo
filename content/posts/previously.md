The best way to start after quite a break...

## Previously, with Lewis

Since the last blog post, my career has gone from here to there, up to down, and everywhere in-between.
Personally I've learned a lot, and as to be expected these lessons aren't limited to technology.
One of the things I've learnt is to reduce pressure on myself.  So for that, this isn't a new beginning and the previous posts are not the end.
The beauty of moving forward is looking back, and looking back can help direct where you want to go next.
