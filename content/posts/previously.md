The best way to start after quite a break...

## Previously, with Lewis

Since the last blog post, my career has gone from here to there, up to down, and everywhere in-between.
Personally I've learned a lot, and as to be expected these lessons aren't limited to technology.
One of the things I've learnt is to reduce pressure on myself.  So for that, this isn't a new beginning and the previous posts are not the end.
The beauty of moving forward is looking back, and looking back can help direct where you want to go next.

## Leaving DotNet for Cloud Native

Looking for a new challenge.

## Training

From attending training sessions to supporting them and eventually leading them.

## Cloud Native Wales

Setting up and keeping a meetup going (and now a podcast)

## No longer contracting

Leaving the contracting lifestyle to settle into full time employment.
