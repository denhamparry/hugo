### Scaling microservices with Message queues, .NET and Kubernetes

Where: [NDC London](https://ndc-london.com).
Date:  30th January 2019.

When you design and build applications at scale, you deal with two significant challenges: scalability & robustness. You should design your service so that even if it is subject to intermittent heavy loads, it continues to operate reliably. But how do you build such applications? And how do you deploy an application that scales dynamically? Kubernetes has a feature called autoscaler where instances of your applications are increased or decreased automatically based on metrics that you define.

In this talk, youâ€™ll learn how to design, package & deploy reliable .NET applications to Kubernetes & decouple several components using a message broker. You will also learn how to set autoscaling rules to cope with an increasing influx of messages in the queue.
