### Scaling microservices with Message queues, .NET and Kubernetes

Where: [NDC London](https://ndc-london.com).
Date:  30th January 2019.

When you design and build applications at scale, you deal with two significant challenges: scalability & robustness. You should design your service so that even if it is subject to intermittent heavy loads, it continues to operate reliably. But how do you build such applications? And how do you deploy an application that scales dynamically? Kubernetes has a feature called autoscaler where instances of your applications are increased or decreased automatically based on metrics that you define.

In this talk, you’ll learn how to design, package & deploy reliable .NET applications to Kubernetes & decouple several components using a message broker. You will also learn how to set autoscaling rules to cope with an increasing influx of messages in the queue.

### One Monolith / One Macroservice / Many Microservices

Where: [µCon London 2018 - The Microservices Conference](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/10336-mucon-london-2018-the-microservices-conference#skillscasts).
Date:  5th November 2018.

From working with a number of companies, the only constant is seeing that each company has their own way of migrating from a monolith to a microservice architecture, and it never working out as planned. In this talk Lewis will share with you the idea of embracing your monolith and making it a macroservice. He’ll explore the benefits of this approach from both a technical and business perspective, and plan how to convert this macroserivce into microservices.
